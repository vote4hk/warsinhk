## üöÄ Quick start

### Set up your environment

Navigate to the project directory and run the below command to install all the dependencies of project

```bash
yarn
```

### Start your local development

```bash
gatsby develop
```

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

**Note:**

- You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).
- Gatsby requires Node.js 10.13.0 or higher. If your version is below the required one, try to upgrade it or following the below steps to switch to the desired version using [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm):
  Run the following command to use the version from inside the `.nvmrc` file
  ```bash
  nvm use
  ```
  If the specified version is not found, please run the following command to install
  ```bash
  nvm install
  ```

### Pull Requests

- Please follow our pull request template when creating a pull request. Make sure your pull request fulfils our requirement.
- Please create a new branch (for each PR) based on the latest `dev` or the feature branch and name it either `feat/<meaningful_name>` or `fix/<meaningful_name>`.
- Please follow our naming convention `üåü[feat/fix]: [summary]` (pick your favourite emoji üòâ) for pull request title.

### Checkout the latest code

Please setup `dev` repo `github.com/nandiheath/warsinhk` as `upstream` and `git fetch upstream -p` everytime before making commits. And remember to rebase your branches onto latest `upstream:dev`.

### Internationalization (i18n)

We are using [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) to assert that the internationalized content can be loaded or that it gets rendered when the language changes.

The translation json files for `en` and `zh` are located at `src/locales/en/translation.json` and `src/locales/zh/translation.json` respectively. By default, `zh` is used. If you have changes to the wordings, please make sure they are added or updated in both json files.

**Examples:**

src/locales/en/translation.json

```json
{
  "world.page_title": "Global Cases"
}
```

src/locales/zh/translation.json

```json
{
  "world.page_title": "ÂÖ®ÁêÉÁñ´ÊÉÖËøΩËπ§"
}
```

Use `useTranslation()` for functional components:

```js
// 1. import useTranslation from react-i18next
import { useTranslation } from "react-i18next"
// 2. define t from useTranslation()
const { t } = useTranslation()
// 3. use the t function with the key as the parameter
const title = t("world.page_title")
```

Use `withLanguage()` to translate the target field within an object

```js
// 1. import withLanguage from custom utils
import { withLanguage } from "@/utils/i18n"
// 2. define i18n from useTranslation()
const { i18n } = useTranslation()
// 3. pass i18n, the target object, and the target field name to withLanguage
// if the locale is en, the link would be ``node.address_en``
// if the locale is zh, the link would be ``node.address_zh``
const address = withLanguage(i18n, node, "address")
```

Use `getLocalizedPath(i18n, path)` to get the localized path

```js
// 1. import getLocalizedPath from custom utils
import { getLocalizedPath } from "@/utils/i18n"
// 2. define i18n from useTranslation()
const { i18n } = useTranslation()
// 3. pass i18n and the path to getLocalizedPath
// if the locale is en, the link would be ``/en/world``
// if the locale is zh, the link would be ``/zh/world``
<Link
  href={getLocalizedPath(i18n, "/world")}
>
  ...
</Link>
```

For interpolation, surround the dynamic value by curly brackets in `translation.json`

```json
{
  "world.border_shutdown_last_update": "Last update: {{date}}"
}
```

and pass an object with the key defined in curly brackets and the dynamic value in the second parameter

```js
{
  t("world.border_shutdown_last_update", { date: last_update })
}
```

### Analyse code for potential errors

Run eslint to ensure it fits linting

```bash
yarn lint
yarn lint:fix
```

Try to build to see if there are any errors.

```bash
yarn build
```
