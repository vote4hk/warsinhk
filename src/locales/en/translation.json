Note that due to the increased demand for medical supplies worldwide, the cost of medical supplies has gone up as well; pharmacies that simply sell legitimate medical supplies at higher prices are not necessarily dubious. We recommend paying more attention to stores that sell defective products (e.g. used or low-quality masks, diluted rubbing alcohol, etc.) over stores that simply price-gouge. If you have any further issues, please consider contacting the Hong Kong Consumer Council.",

In view of the disease becoming increasingly threatening, the vote4hk team started collecting information both from internet and government sources on 26 January. Two days later, we uploaded this website, \"COVID-19 in HK\", where we aim to integrate information about high-risk areas, patientsâ€™ conditions, information about dubious stores and health tips.",
