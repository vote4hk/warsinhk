  "dodgy_shops.disclaimer": "The following information on dubious pharmacies is an integration of netizens’ reports. Given that there is now a huge demand for different medical supplies all over the world, it is inevitable that the procurement costs and transportation are pushed up. As a result, pharmacies selling medical supplies at a higher price point than usual doesn't necessarily mean that they are dubious stores trying to earn a higher profit. Therefore, when referring to this list, please pay closer attention to stores selling fake supplies (e.g. used or low-quality masks, diluted rubbing alcohol, etc.). If you are uncertain about the situation, you can also consider contacting the Hong Kong Consumer Council.",
